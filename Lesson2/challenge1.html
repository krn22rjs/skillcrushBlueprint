      <h1>My Favorite Tips for Freelances</h1>
        <p>Becoming a freelance was one of the best career decisions I've ever
        made. So I want to share some of the most important things I learned <br>
        to help you succeed as a freelancer.</p>

      <h2>Project Management</h2>
        <p>To succeed as a freelancer, you need to be organized when it comes
        to your work. Whether you're working on a solo project or as part of <br>
        larger team, you need to know how to <strong>manage your time and
        resources</strong> effectively.</p>

        <h3>Promotion</h3>
          <p>As a freelancer, you need to get your name out there so potential
          clients can find you. <strong>Promoting yourself online</strong> these
          days is a snap!</p>

        <h4>Social Media</h4>
          <p>One of the best ways to promote your services is through <strong>
          social media.</strong> Be sure to use a scheduling tool to save
          yourself some time and <br> effort.</p>
