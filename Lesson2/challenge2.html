    <h2>LESSON CHALLENGE</h2>
    <h1>TYPESET A POEM BY THE METAPHYSICAL ADVENTURESS</h1>
    <h3>WHAT TO DO:</h3>

      <p>One of my favorite poets is the marvelous Emily Dickinson. I love to
         fantasize about <br> her shut inside of her Massachusetts home, wearing
         white ruffly shirts, and wirting <br> impossibly romantic poetry.
      </p>

      <p>In honor of Emily, copy and past the following poem into the code editor
         and use <br> the HTML tags you now know to typeset it. Use headlines
         where appropriate, tags if you like'em and feel free to throw a <strong>
         break</strong> or <strong>em</strong> tag in there where <br>
         appropriate.</p>

      <p>Ah, and since Ms. Dickinson was so fond of them ... you can use the (HTML)
      special <br> character for those famous em dashes which is (&mdash;)
      no greater than or less <br> than symbols required. Learn more about
      special characters.</p>

      <!-- Here is where the actual lesson challenge begins -->

      <h1> A Coffin-is a Small Domain</h1>
        <p>A Coffin-is a small Domain,<br>
           Yet able to contain <br>
           A Citizen of Paradise <br>
           In it diminished Plane.</p>

          <p>A Grave-is a restricted Breadth- <br>
             Yet ampler than the Sun- <br>
             And all the Seas He populates <br>
             And Lands He looks upon</p>

             <p>To Him who onits small Repose <br>
                Bestows a single Fried- <br>
                Circumference without Relief- <br>
              Or Estimate-or End-</p>
