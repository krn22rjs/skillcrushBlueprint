    <h1>Lesson challenge: Add some tags to this text.</h1>

    <h2>What to do:</h2>
      <p>Ready to try writing some HtML? Let's give Dickens some structure ...
      because OH boy look at how long that sentence is!</p>
      <p>It could really use some h1 and p tags. Where do they go?</p>


      <h1>YOUR SOLUTION</h1>

      <!-- HERE IS YOUR SOLUTION -->
      <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.<p>
      <p>It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.</p>
      <p>It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,<br>
        it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, <br>
        it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,<br>
        we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
        we were all going direct to Heaven,<br>
        we were all going direct the other way <br>
        â€“ in short, the period was so far like the present period, <br>
        that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received,<br>
        for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
